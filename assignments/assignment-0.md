# Assignment 0

Before you begin the course project, there are a few tasks you need to complete. These tasks will not be graded, but *you will not be able to work on the project unless you complete them*.

1. [(Required) Provide your Github username on Canvas](#submitting-github-username)
2. [(Required) Install Git Client if you don't have it already](#install-git-client)
3. [(Required) Install Node.js if you don't have it already](#install-nodejs)
4. [(Required from Assignment 4) Install MongoDB if you don't have it already](#install-mongodb)

## Submitting Github Username

We use Github to synchronize all the code you write for the course project. Hence, *you must complete this task* before you can start working on the project. Refer to the [setup walk-through](setup.md) for detailed instructions.

## Install Git Client

As mentioned, since we use Github to manage code, you will need Git Client on your machine to push/pull from Github. You can either install the [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [Github Desktop (GUI)](https://desktop.github.com/).


## Install NodeJS

Although there won't be JavaScript in the next assignment, you will use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to start a local web server and serve your client-side application. Hence, *you must complete this task* before you can start working on your course project. In addition, NodeJS is very useful for quickly testing your JavaScript code during class activities.

You can find the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md).


## Install MongoDB

This is not required in the next assignment, but you will be using MongoDB later in the course (from Assignment 4 onwards). Feel free to skip this task for now if you prefer to install it later.

You can find the setup instructions [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/).
